# Price Query

This is a project for querying product price information. It is a modular application based on **Hexagonal Architecture**, using **H2** as an in-memory database with initial data.

## Requirements

- **Java 17**
- **Maven 3.9.9**

## Description

This project follows the **Hexagonal Architecture** pattern, which allows for a clear separation of concerns between the domain and external interfaces (such as databases, APIs, etc.). The database used is **H2**, which is configured to store initial test data when the application is run.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diegoariasm233/pruebaTecnica2

2. Compile the project using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install

3. Run the application:

   If you wish to run the application directly, you can use the following Maven command:

    ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -f infrastructure/pom.xml

This will start the application, and the H2 database will be initialized with the preconfigured data defined in the data.sql file.

# Running Tests

If you want to run the tests, you can do so with the following command
    
    mvn test

This will execute all the unit and integration tests for the application.

# Access to the H2 Console
You can access the H2 web console to inspect the database at:

http://localhost:8080/h2-console
